# Supplementary Details for Final Year Project thesis
This repository contains most, if not all, input and output files for the two crystals studied in my thesis.
They are fluorographene (FG, chemical formula CF) in 2 different conformations: chair and zigzag (a.k.a. stirrup/washboard)

## Computational Information
Calculations were done in the framework of Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Density Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT) using QUANTUM ESPRESSO.

The following were calculated for both crystals:
- Cutoff energy and k-point sampling convergence
- Structural relaxation (variable cell)
- Electronic properties
  - Energy band diagram
  - Density of States (DoS) and partial DoS (pDoS)
- Vibrational Properties
  - Phonon dispersion diagram 
  - Density of States (DoS) and partial DoS (pDoS)

Details on each item are in the README of their respective directories. (WIP)
